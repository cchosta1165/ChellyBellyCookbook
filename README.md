Final Project for fewd21

My final project is a recipe cookbook website

I have taken a couple of my favorite receipes to cook and shared them on the wesite. This includes pictures of the receipe, ingredients, and instructions.

I have created a nav bar that changes in different screen sizes. 

Features:
nav bar
rotated images on hover -> on home page
javascript-> clears the defaulted text when person clicks on the comment section in the Contact.html

Please follow along with the receipes and Enjoy!
